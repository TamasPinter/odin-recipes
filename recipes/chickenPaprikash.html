    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A delicious and hearty home meal, the Chicken Paprikash is an absolute
      favourite. It is filled with amazing scents and flavours, and goes very
      well with rice or the traditional Hungarian dumplings. Let's get right to
      it!

    <h2>Steps to create Chicken Paprikash</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken generously on both sides with salt. Heat olive oil in
        a<br />
        heavy, deep-sided pan (that comes with a lid) over high heat and
        brown<br />
        the chicken well, skin-side down, about 5 minutes; flip and continue
        to<br />
        sear until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Turn off heat.<br />
        Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and reserve until needed;
        spoon<br />
        out excess chicken fat if desired.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions and a pinch of salt to the same pan and saute over medium<br />
        until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, tomato paste, and flour
        and<br />
        cook, stirring, another 3 to 4 minutes to form a tomato roux. Stir in
        1<br />
        teaspoon kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, smoked paprika,
        and<br />
        sweet paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and bring to a<br />
        simmer over high heat.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low and transfer chicken and accumulated juices<br />
        back into the pan. Baste the tops with the sauce, cover the pan with
        the<br />
        lid, and simmer, basting occasionally with the sauce, until the
        chicken<br />
        is no longer pink in the centers and is fork-tender, 45 to 60
        minutes.<br />
        Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim some fat off the top of the sauce if desired. Whisk heavy cream
        and<br />
        sour cream into the sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring
        occasionally.<br />
        Transfer the chicken and any juices back into the sauce. Simmer,<br />
        uncovered, basting often, until chicken is heated through and very<br />
        tender, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.<br />
