    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, bell
        pepper,<br />
        Anaheim pepper, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in the hot oil until
        softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and<br />
        stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. Crumble bouillon cubes<br />
        over beef and add beer. Continue to cook , scraping any browned bits<br />
        from the bottom of the skillet, until liquid is hot, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir beef mixture into pepper mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and wine to the<br />
        beef mixture. Season with chili powder, 2 tablespoons cumin, brown<br />
        sugar, pepper sauce, basil, paprika, salt, oregano, and black pepper.
      </li>

        Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until<br />
        meat and vegetables are very tender and flavors have developed in the<br />
        chili, about 90 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix kidney beans into beef and vegetables. Continue to simmer until<br />
        beans are hot, about 30 minutes more.

        Blend sour cream, cilantro, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a<br />
        food processor until smooth. Serve sour cream mixture with chili.
